# CrickCoach - Company Business Description

## Business Overview

**CrickCoach** is a mobile application that provides AI-powered cricket coaching and technique analysis to cricket players of all skill levels. The application leverages artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to offer personalized coaching feedback, technique improvement recommendations, and progress tracking.

## What CrickCoach Does

CrickCoach is a comprehensive cricket coaching mobile application that uses artificial intelligence to analyze cricket players' techniques and provide personalized coaching feedback. Users simply record or upload a video of themselves performing cricket actions—whether batting or bowling—and the application automatically analyzes their movements using advanced AI technology. The system identifies specific cricket shots (such as cover drives or pull shots for batsmen) or bowling styles, evaluates body positioning, movement patterns, and biomechanics, compares the player's technique against established coaching benchmarks, and identifies specific technical flaws with precise measurements. Based on this analysis, CrickCoach provides actionable recommendations, suggests specific practice drills, and offers general improvement tips tailored to each player's unique technique. The application also tracks progress over time by maintaining a complete history of all analyses, allowing players to review their past sessions, monitor improvements, and identify areas that still need work. Additionally, CrickCoach generates customized training plans based on the analysis results, providing structured practice schedules designed to address identified weaknesses. The application serves both batsmen and bowlers, accommodates both right-handed and left-handed players, supports various bowling styles including fast bowling and spin bowling, and is designed to be accessible to players at all skill levels, from beginners learning the basics to advanced players seeking to refine their technique.
